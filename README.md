# PSoC_Simple_Stepper_Motor_Controller
A School exercise, where I built a Stepper motor controller on a PSOC 5LD
A description of the exercise can be found under exercise 3 in the PDF. 

There where many things i would have linked to be better in this implmentation. 
Most promenently, 
- Insted of having defined reverse patteren, it should have iterated backwards on the normal patterns. 
And ofcourse more things.
